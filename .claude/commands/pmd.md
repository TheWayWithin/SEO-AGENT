# POST MORTEM DIAGNOSTIC (PMD) üîç

**Command**: `/pmd [issue]`

**Arguments**:
- No arguments: Analyze recent failures and issues
- Issue description: Analyze specific problem

## PMD ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

You are conducting a comprehensive root cause analysis to identify and resolve systemic issues in the SEOAgent project.

### ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

#### 1. ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
Systematically identify problems:
- Recent failures or errors
- Performance degradation
- Missed objectives
- Agent coordination issues
- Tool usage problems

#### 2. DATA COLLECTION
Gather evidence from:
- **Error Logs**: Stack traces, error messages
- **Agent Outputs**: Task completions, responses
- **Mission Records**: Failed or delayed missions
- **Performance Metrics**: Degraded KPIs
- **User Feedback**: Reported issues

#### 3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Apply diagnostic techniques:
- **5 Whys**: Drill down to root cause
- **Fishbone Diagram**: Map contributing factors
- **Timeline Analysis**: Sequence of events
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recurring issues

#### 4. IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Evaluate consequences:
- Business impact (revenue, growth)
- Technical debt accumulated
- User experience degradation
- Team productivity loss
- Future risk exposure

#### 5. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Develop solutions:
- Immediate fixes required
- Long-term improvements
- Process modifications
- Documentation updates
- Training needs

### DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES

#### AGENT PERFORMANCE
- Prompt effectiveness
- Task completion rates
- Response quality
- Coordination efficiency
- Tool usage patterns

#### TECHNICAL ISSUES
- Code quality problems
- Architecture limitations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Integration failures
- Security vulnerabilities

#### PROCESS FAILURES
- Communication breakdowns
- Documentation gaps
- Testing inadequacies
- Deployment issues
- Monitoring blind spots

#### COORDINATION PROBLEMS
- Agent conflicts
- Unclear responsibilities
- Mission planning gaps
- Resource allocation
- Timeline management

### ANALYSIS SOURCES

Examine these locations:
1. **Progress Tracking**:
   - `/progress.md` - Issue logs
   - `/project-plan.md` - Failed tasks
   
2. **Agent Artifacts**:
   - Agent responses and outputs
   - Mission completion records
   - Tool usage patterns

3. **System Metrics**:
   - `/tracking/` - Performance data
   - Error logs and stack traces
   - API response times

4. **Documentation**:
   - README files for gaps
   - Agent prompts for issues
   - Mission templates for problems

### DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

Use these approaches:
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify recurring issues
- **Correlation Study**: Link cause and effect
- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantify impact
- **Comparative Analysis**: Before/after states
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Gather context

### EXAMPLE USAGE

```bash
# Analyze recent failures
/pmd

# Analyze specific agent issue
/pmd "SEO Analyst agent not returning metrics"

# Analyze coordination problem
/pmd "Coordinator not delegating tasks properly"

# Analyze technical issue
/pmd "Tracking system failing to capture baselines"
```

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Root cause correctly identified
- Evidence clearly documented
- Impact accurately assessed
- Actions are specific and assignable
- Prevention measures implemented
- Learning captured for future

## BEGIN DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS

Conduct the post mortem diagnostic based on the provided issue or analyze recent failures if no specific issue is given. Focus on actionable findings and concrete improvements.
