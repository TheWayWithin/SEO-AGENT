Transformed sub-agent orchestration from optional to mandatory context sharing using BOS-AI's three-layer context preservation system.

#### New Components Added:

1. **Context File Templates** (4 files)
   - `/templates/seo-context-template.md` - Mission overview and key discoveries
   - `/templates/seo-handoff-template.md` - Agent-to-agent task handoffs
   - `/templates/seo-evidence-template.md` - Shared evidence repository
   - `/templates/mission-state-template.md` - Real-time mission tracking

2. **Coordinator Enhancements**
   - Mandatory context file initialization at mission start
   - Context preservation validation after each task
   - Phase boundary compliance checks
   - Context failure logging in progress.md

3. **SEO Agent Updates** (All 6 agents)
   - Added mandatory context protocol sections
   - Context preservation requirements before starting work
   - Required updates to context files during execution
   - Handoff document creation for next agent
   - Context compliance tracking metrics (100% required)

4. **Mission Template Updates**
   - Context initialization requirements added
   - Phase-level context preservation protocols
   - Example implementation in ai-search-optimize.md

#### Expected Benefits:
- **50-70% reduction** in context loss between agents
- **100% mandatory** context preservation compliance
- **Real-time visibility** into mission progress
- **Evidence-based** decision tracking
- **Enhanced ROI tracking** through preserved data
