```
Mission Start
    ↓
✅ Initialize 4 context files from templates
    ↓
✅ Agent reads context → performs work → updates context → creates handoff
    ↓
✅ Next agent reads context + handoff → continues chain
    ↓
✅ Coordinator validates at phase boundaries
    ↓
Mission Complete with full context preservation
```
